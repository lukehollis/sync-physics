Initial Prompt

Carefully reason through, plan, and build a complete, working three.js application demonstrating a soft-body cloth simulation using the Ammo.js physics engine. The final result should be an interactive scene similar to the one in the provided image.

Use a standard modern web project structure: index.html, style.css, and a main JavaScript file (main.js).

Load three.js and Ammo.js via CDNs or local files.

Implement OrbitControls for camera manipulation.

The specific requirements for the initial scene are as follows:

Scene Setup:

World: A basic scene with a floor/ground plane and standard lighting (e.g., an AmbientLight and a DirectionalLight to cast shadows).

Collision Objects:

A static, non-movable sphere positioned in the center of the scene.

A static, non-movable ground plane.

Cloth:

Create a three.js PlaneGeometry to serve as the visual basis for the cloth.

Position the cloth above the sphere.

"Pin" the two top corners of the cloth so that they remain fixed in space, allowing the rest of the cloth to drape over the sphere under the influence of gravity.

Physics:

Initialize the Ammo.js physics world with standard gravity (e.g., -9.8 on the Y-axis).

Create an Ammo.btSoftBody corresponding to the cloth's geometry.

Create Ammo.btRigidBody objects for the static sphere and ground plane.

In the animation loop, step the physics simulation forward and update the vertices of the three.js cloth mesh to match the positions of the nodes in the Ammo.js soft body.

Fixing Underspecification
The original specification creates a nice but passive demonstration. To make it a more compelling and robust application, we will add interactivity and more dynamic features.

The original specification is not interactive
The user can only orbit the camera and watch the cloth settle. There is no way to interact with the simulation after it starts.

Response:

I inspected the initial setup. The scene is static once the cloth comes to rest. I will add mouse controls to directly manipulate the cloth.

What I changed
I implemented mouse picking using a `three.js` `Raycaster`.

- On `mousedown`, the raycaster identifies the vertex on the cloth mesh closest to the cursor.
- I create a temporary anchor point in the physics world to move that vertex.
- As the user drags the mouse (`mousemove`), the anchor's position is updated, pulling the cloth around.
- On `mouseup`, the anchor is removed, and the cloth behaves naturally again.
  The simulation lacks dynamic object interaction
  The cloth only interacts with static objects defined at the start. Adding dynamic objects would better showcase the capabilities of the physics engine.

Response:

To improve the demonstration, I've added a feature to shoot small, dynamic spheres at the cloth.

What I changed

- I added a key listener for the 'Space' key.
- When pressed, a new `three.js` sphere and a corresponding dynamic `Ammo.js` rigid body are created.
- The new rigid body is given an initial linear velocity, launching it from the camera's position towards the center of the scene.
- These dynamic spheres will realistically collide with and deform the cloth before falling to the ground plane.
  The cloth is indestructible and unrealistic under high stress
  Currently, the cloth can be stretched indefinitely without any consequence, which is not how real fabric behaves.

Response:

You're rightâ€”the cloth feels like an unbreakable rubber sheet. I will implement a basic tearing mechanism to make the simulation more realistic.

What I changed

- During the physics update, I now iterate through the links (constraints) between the soft body's vertices.
- I calculate the current distance ($d$) between two linked vertices and compare it to their initial distance ($d_{initial}$).
- If the distance exceeds a predefined stress threshold (e.g., $d > 1.8 \cdot d_{initial}$), I remove the link between those two vertices from the `Ammo.btSoftBody`.
- This allows holes and tears to form naturally when the cloth is pulled too hard or hit with a forceful impact.
