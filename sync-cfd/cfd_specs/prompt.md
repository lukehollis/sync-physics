Initial Prompt

Carefully reason through, plan, and build the following: A complete, working web application for setting up, running, and visualizing basic CFD simulations. The application will feature a three.js frontend for 3D visualization and a Python backend using FastAPI to manage and execute the physics simulations.

The frontend code is located in the ./client directory and uses three.js and react.

The backend code is located in the ./api directory and uses FastAPI.

Backend CFD simulations will utilize industry-standard Python libraries like FEniCSx (for solving PDEs), meshio (for mesh handling), and pyvista (for post-processing).

Individual simulation physics backend simulation cases will be stored under ./api/simulations/{simulation_type}.py

The specific requirements, inspired by the visualization in the provided image, are as follows:

1. Simulation Setup & Dashboard
This page allows users to configure and manage their simulations.

Simulation List: Shows a list of all simulations the user has created.

Actions:

Delete Simulation: A button to delete a simulation case and its associated data.

New Simulation: A form to create a new simulation which includes:

Name: A user-defined name for the simulation.

Mesh Upload: An input to upload a 2D or 3D mesh file (e.g., .msh, .vtk).

Physics Inputs: Simple fields for essential parameters like Inlet Velocity, Fluid Density, and Viscosity.

Start/Stop: Controls to initiate or terminate a simulation run on the backend.

Navigation:

Clicking the app logo returns the user to this dashboard.

Clicking a simulation name navigates to its unique Visualization Page.

2. Visualization Page
This page uses three.js to render the results of a completed or in-progress simulation. The goal is to reproduce visualizations similar to the provided image, showing fluid flow around an object.

3D Viewport: A large canvas displaying the simulation mesh and results.

Standard camera controls (pan, zoom, orbit) should be implemented.

Visualization Controls: UI elements to manipulate the display.

Show/Hide Mesh: Toggle the visibility of the underlying wireframe mesh.

Plot Type: A dropdown to switch between different data visualizations:

Velocity Vectors (Glyphs): Display arrows indicating the direction and magnitude of flow, as seen in the reference image.

Pressure Contours: A color map showing pressure distribution on the object's surface and in the surrounding fluid.

Slicing Plane: For 3D simulations, a tool to create a 2D plane that cuts through the volume to show the internal flow.

Data Loading: The page should fetch post-processed simulation data from a dedicated backend endpoint.

Fixing Underspecification
A naive implementation of this application would face significant performance and usability challenges. Here are some potential issues and their solutions:

Original Specification Is Ambiguous About Data Transfer
A raw CFD result file can be hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes. Sending this entire dataset to the browser for three.js to parse would be extremely slow and likely crash the browser tab.

Response:

I inspected the backend-frontend data flow. The initial plan had the frontend requesting the raw result files, which is inefficient.

What I Changed:

Backend Post-Processing: I added a pyvista-based post-processing step to the backend. When a simulation is finished (or at a given interval), the backend generates a lightweight visualization-ready file (e.g., .gltf or .vtp). This file contains only the necessary geometry and data for rendering, such as decimated surface meshes and vector glyphs.

Optimized websocket Endpoint: I created a new websocket endpoint, /ws/cfd, that serves this pre-processed, lightweight file. The three.js client now loads this file directly, resulting in a massively improved load time and smoother user experience.

Tidying Up the Visualization and Adding Context
The initial visualization might just be a colorful object, but it lacks context. The user doesn't know what the colors or vectors mean, and there's no way to analyze the simulation over time.

Response:

Iâ€™ve updated the visualization page to be more interactive and informative.

What I Changed:

Color Legend: The frontend now renders a color bar legend in the corner of the viewport. This legend maps the colors in the pressure contour plot to their corresponding numerical values (e.g., in Pascals).

Time Step Navigation: The backend now saves a results snapshot at regular intervals during the simulation run. I've added Prev/Next buttons to the frontend UI, allowing the user to step through the simulation's timeline and observe how the flow develops.

Data Probe: Implemented a "probe" tool. When activated, clicking on any point in the visualization displays the exact data values (e.g., pressure, velocity vector (u, v, w)) at that coordinate in a small overlay.
