Initial prompt

Carefully reason through, plan, and build the following: A complete working application for training a drone to hover using Reinforcement Learning.

The application will feature a Three.js frontend to visualize the simulation and a Python backend using Stable-Baselines3 (SB3) to run the RL environment and training loop. The project should be based on the pre-existing "genesis drone hovering example" found in the api/simulations directory.

The frontend code should be located in the ./client directory.

The backend API and simulation environment should be in the ./api directory.

The specific requirements are as follows:

@main.jpg

Main Simulation View: This is the primary interface, showing the drone in a 3D environment.

Visualization: Display the drone model and the checkerboard ground plane. The drone's state (position, orientation) should update in real-time based on the backend simulation.

Display Info: Show key metrics directly on the viewport, such as current cumulative reward, episode number, and timestep.

Controls:

Start Training: Begins the SB3 training loop on the backend.

Stop Training: Halts the training loop.

Reset Environment: Resets the drone to its starting position.

@dashboard.png

Training Dashboard Panel: A simple UI panel on the main page to control and monitor the training process.

Actions:

Select Algorithm: A dropdown to choose an SB3 algorithm (e.g., PPO, A2C, SAC).

Save Model: Saves the current trained SB3 model to the backend.

Load Model: Loads a previously saved model to continue training or for evaluation.

Live Plot: Display a real-time chart of the reward per episode to visualize learning progress.

Fixing underspecification
The original specification is a good starting point, but RL projects often require iterative refinement. Here are some anticipated issues and their solutions.

The drone immediately flips over or flies away indefinitely.
The initial random policy and a sparse reward function will likely cause unstable behavior, making it impossible for the agent to learn.

Response:

I've refined the HoverEnv simulation to make learning more stable. The core issue was a combination of a reward function that only rewarded being at the target and a lack of termination conditions for instability.

What I changed:

Reward Shaping: In api/simulations/hover_env.py, I implemented a dense reward function. The new reward is calculated each step as:
R 
t
​
 =−k 
1
​
 ⋅∣∣ 
p

​
  
drone
​
 − 
p

​
  
target
​
 ∣∣−k 
2
​
 ⋅∣∣ 
v

  
drone
​
 ∣∣−k 
3
​
 ⋅∣θ 
tilt
​
 ∣
This penalizes distance from the target, high velocity, and excessive tilt, guiding the agent toward stable flight.

Termination Conditions: I added done conditions to end an episode if the drone's altitude is too low/high or if its tilt angle exceeds 45 degrees. This prevents the agent from exploring useless states.

The frontend visualization is static and doesn't reflect the simulation.
The initial prompt asks for a visualization but doesn't specify the communication protocol between the Python backend and the Three.js frontend.

Response:

I established a real-time link between the backend simulation and the frontend renderer. A simple HTTP API is insufficient for the continuous stream of state data required for smooth animation.

What I changed:

Backend (api/simulations/drone_hovering.py): I added a WebSocket endpoint. When a training session starts, the backend simulation loop now emits the drone's state (position and quaternion rotation) over the WebSocket on every step.

Frontend (client/src/views/DroneHovering.jsx): The Three.js client now establishes a WebSocket connection to the backend. An onmessage listener parses the incoming state data and updates the drone.position and drone.quaternion properties within the animation loop (requestAnimationFrame).

It's difficult to tell if the agent is actually learning.
While the drone might appear more stable, there is no quantitative way to see the training progress over time from the UI.

Response:

I've implemented the real-time progress chart on the dashboard. The backend was already calculating the reward, but it wasn't being sent to the frontend for visualization.

What I changed:

Backend (api/simulations/drone_hovering.py): The WebSocket message now includes the cumulative reward for the current episode alongside the drone's state data.

Frontend (client/src/views/DroneHovering.jsx): I added a simple plotting library (like Chart.js) to the project. The WebSocket listener now passes the reward value to a function that updates the chart, adding a new data point at the end of each episode. This provides immediate visual feedback on the agent's performance.
